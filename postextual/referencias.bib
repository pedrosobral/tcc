	abstract = {An audience response system (ARS) permits students to respond to multiple choice questions using a remote control device. All responses are instantly displayed, usually in chart form, and subsequently reviewed and discussed by the instructor and the class. This paper offers a comprehensive review of teaching strategies used with ARS and includes a discussion of general, motivational, assessment based, and learning based approaches. Several promising strategies have been identified, particularly collecting formative assessment feedback and peer based instruction. More systematic, detailed research in a broader range of contexts is recommended. },

Em termos educacionais, pesquisa ap{\'{o}}s pesquisa tem mostrado os problemas de se investir quase exclusivamente na apresenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o oral dos conte{\'{u}}dos como estrat{\'{e}}gia did{\'{a}}tica. Seja por falta de infraestrutura para implementar novas solu{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es, in{\'{e}}rcia do sistema escolar ou mesmo desconhecimento de alternativas vi{\'{a}}veis de mudan{\c{c}}a, essa estrat{\'{e}}gia quase milenar ainda hoje {\'{e}} onipresente no ambiente escolar. Em sua face mais vis{\'{i}}vel, o chamado ensino tradicional est{\'{a}} fortemente associado com a evas{\~{a}}o escolar, a aprendizagem mec{\^{a}}nica e a desmotiva{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o para aprender, por parte dos estudantes. Diversas s{\~{a}}o as recomenda{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es abstratas e gerais de cunho pedag{\'{o}}gico feitas aos professores para reverter esse quadro.

@article{Gok2013,
abstract = {The effects of peer instruction (PI) and formal education (FE) on students' performance, skill, and confidence were investigated. The research was performed in a two-year college classroom with 98 students from two groups enrolled in a physics course. One of the groups was selected as an experimental group, and the other was the control group. The students in the experimental group were instructed by peer instruction with problem solving strategy steps (PSSS), whereas the students in the control group were instructed by formal education including PSSS. The research data were collected with the Physics Achievement Test (PAT) and the Problem Solving Confidence Questionnaire (PSCQ). The problem solving skills of the students in both groups were evaluated using quantitative problems in Newtonian mechanics. The PAT and the PSCQ results related to the performance and confidence of the students indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the means of the experimental group and the control group in favor of the experimental group. The combination of PI with PSSS was more effective for increasing the problem solving skills of the students than the combination of FE with PSSS. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Freeman2014,
abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6{\%} in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes-although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

We also discuss ways we have improved our implementation of PI since introducing it in 1991. Most notably, we have replaced in-class reading quizzes with pre-class written responses to the reading, introduced a research-based mechanics textbook for portions of the course, and incorporated cooperative learning into the discussion sections as well as the lectures. These improvements are intended to help students learn more from pre-class reading and to increase student engagement in the discussion sections, and are accompanied by further increases in student understanding.},
