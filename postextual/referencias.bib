All responses are instantly displayed, usually in chart form, and subsequently reviewed and discussed by the instructor and the class. This paper offers a comprehensive review of teaching strategies used with ARS and includes a discussion of general, motivational, assessment based, and learning based approaches. Several promising strategies have been identified, particularly collecting formative assessment feedback and peer based instruction. More systematic, detailed research in a broader range of contexts is recommended. },

abstract = {The effects of peer instruction (PI) and formal education (FE) on students' performance, skill, and confidence were investigated. The research was performed in a two-year college classroom with 98 students from two groups enrolled in a physics course. One of the groups was selected as an experimental group, and the other was the control group. The students in the experimental group were instructed by peer instruction with problem solving strategy steps (PSSS), whereas the students in the control group were instructed by formal education including PSSS. The research data were collected with the Physics Achievement Test (PAT) and the Problem Solving Confidence Questionnaire (PSCQ). The problem solving skills of the students in both groups were evaluated using quantitative problems in Newtonian mechanics. The PAT and the PSCQ results related to the performance and confidence of the students indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the means of the experimental group and the control group in favor of the experimental group. The combination of PI with PSSS was more effective for increasing the problem solving skills of the students than the combination of FE with PSSS. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6{\%} in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes-although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

Peer Instruction is an instructional strategy for engaging students during class through a structured questioning process that involves every student. Here we describe Peer Instruction (hereafter PI) and report data from more than ten years of teaching with PI in the calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics courses for non-majors at Harvard University, where this method was developed. Our results indicate increased student mastery of both conceptual reasoning and quantitative problem solving upon implementing PI. Gains in student understanding are greatest when the PI questioning strategy is accompanied by other strategies that increase student engagement, so that every element of the course serves to involve students actively. We also provide data on gains in student understanding and information about implementation obtained from a survey of almost four hundred instructors using PI at other institutions. We find that most of these instructors have had success using PI, and that their students understand basic mechanics concepts at the level characteristic of courses taught with interactive engagement methods. Finally, we provide a sample set of materials for teaching a class with PI, and provide information on the extensive resources available for teaching with PI.},

abstract = {As more and more educational institutions are integrating new technologies (e.g. audience response systems) into their learning systems to support the learning process, it is becoming increasingly necessary to have a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these advanced technologies and their consequences on student learning performance. In this study, our primary objective is to investigate the effect of clickers (i.e. audience response systems) on student learning performance. To do so, we develop a conceptual framework in which we propose that interactivity, active collaborative learning and engagement are three key underlying forces that explain the positive effects and benefits of clickers in enhancing student learning performance. We test these relationships empirically in a university class setting using data from a survey answered by students in a social sciences degree. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework and they reveal that the high level of interactivity with peers and with the teacher that is promoted by the use of clickers positively influences active collaborative learning and engagement, which, in turn, improves student learning performance. These results show the importance of clickers in improving the student learning experience and recommend their use in educational settings to support the learning process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Morrell2015,
abstract = {Audience response systems ('clickers') are frequently used to promote participation in large lecture classes, and evidence suggests that they convey a number of benefits to students, including improved academic performance and student satisfaction. The limitations of these systems (such as limited access and cost) can be overcome using students' personal electronic devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops together with text message, web-or app-based polling systems. Using questionnaires, we compare student perceptions of clicker and smartphone based polling systems. We find that students prefer interactive lectures generally, but those that used their own device preferred those lectures over lectures using clickers. However, device users were more likely to report using their devices for other purposes (checking email, social media etc.) when they were available to answer polling questions. These students did not feel that this distracted them from the lecture, instead, concerns over the use of smartphones centred around increased battery usage and inclusivity for students without access to suitable technology. Our results suggest that students generally preferred to use their own devices over clickers, and that this may be a sensible way to overcome some of the limitations associated with clickers, although issues surrounding levels of distraction and the implications for retention and recall of information need further investigation.},

In one of two classes, students using mobile devices had a greater number of missing responses and fewer correct responses than students using clickers, but there were no differences in final grades. In the other class, there were no differences on these measures. Overall, students' attitudes toward using clickers and mobile devices were favorable, but 31{\%} of those who reported using a mobile device could not connect to the Internet "sometimes" or "most of the time." Of those who completed the technology survey, the majority (58{\%}) reported being "never" or "rarely" distracted by other uses of their mobile device during class.

abstract = {The teaching-learning process of scientific complex content has been a challenge for teachers trained in traditional instructional method. In this model, faculty members act like actors on the stage. They memorize their speech and deliver it to the audience, many times with very little to no interaction at all with them. On the other hand, in the student- centered learning paradigm the faculty members act like coaches, interacting full time with their team. The aim of this study was to develop a teaching strategy using clickers (or audience response system - ARS) that promotes interactive learning. A survey was applied (to medical students and participants of the Brazilian Society of Immunology Congress) to identify factors influencing Immunology learning. Clicker's resources were analyzed to be used in Immunology classes. The strategy was developed and applied to participants of a Basic Immunology Outreach Course offered for K-12 teachers and health professionals. A set of questions were tested for monitoring the progression of the contents understanding related to immune system function and identification of preconceptions. Most of the participants answered that Immunology is difficult to learn mainly because of the content. Two kinds of clickers were found: apps and sites. The site Poll Everywhere was chosen mainly because it is built for all mobile systems. The clicker strategy was easy to apply and showed promising results, since participants: were motivated; paid more attention; were engaged to discuss; and would like to apply the ARS with their own classes at school. However, some problems were noted: the internet requirement; and non-digital natives had initial difficulties to enter the webpage and to manage their wearable devices. Thus, it was concluded that the use of smart clickers proved to be a very interesting resource for the transition from traditional to active learning methodology, letting both teachers and students feel comfortable encouraging active engagement in the classroom.},

@article{Fotaris2016,
abstract = {Conventional taught learning practices often experience difficulties in keeping students motivated and engaged. Video games, however, are very successful at sustaining high levels of motivation and engagement through a set of tasks for hours without apparent loss of focus. In addition, gamers solve complex problems within a gaming environment without feeling fatigue or frustration, as they would typically do with a comparable learning task. Based on this notion, the academic community is keen on exploring methods that can deliver deep learner engagement and has shown increased interest in adopting gamification – the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into non-game situations and scenarios – as a means to increase student engagement and improve information retention. Its effectiveness when applied to education has been debatable though, as attempts have generally been restricted to one-dimensional approaches such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching materials and/or assessments. Nevertheless, a gamified, multi-dimensional, problem-based learning approach can yield improved results even when applied to a very complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming, as shown in this paper. The presented quasi-experimental study used a combination of instructor feedback, real time sequence of scored quizzes, and live coding to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. More specifically, the “Kahoot!” Classroom Response System (CRS), the classroom version of the TV game show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?”, and Codecademy's interactive platform formed the basis for a learning model which was applied to an entry-level Python programming course. Students were thus allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to those commonly found in a top quality game experience. To assess gamification's impact on learning, empirical data from the gamified group were compared to those from a control group who was taught through a traditional learning approach, similar to the one which had been used during previous cohorts. Despite this being a relatively small-scale study, the results and findings for a number of key metrics, including attendance, downloading of course material, and final grades, were encouraging and proved that the gamified approach was motivating and enriching for both students and instructors.},

@article{Mayer2009,
abstract = {What can be done to promote student-instructor interaction in a large lecture class? One approach is to use a personal response system (or "clickers") in which students press a button on a hand-held remote control device corresponding to their answer to a multiple choice question projected on a screen, then see the class distribution of answers on a screen, and discuss the thinking that leads to the correct answer. Students scored significantly higher on the course exams in a college-level educational psychology class when they used clickers to answer 2 to 4 questions per lecture (clicker group), as compared to an identical class with in-class questions presented without clickers (no-clicker group, d = 0.38) or with no in-class questions (control group, d = 0.40). The clicker treatment produced a gain of approximately 1/3 of a grade point over the no-clicker and control groups, which did not differ significantly from each other. Results are consistent with the generative theory of learning, which predicts students in the clicker group are more cognitively engaged during learning. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Strasser2010,
abstract = {A typical Calculus class tends not to be very interactive. Students view the class as passive. The students expect the instructor to provide the information with very little activity or effort on their part. Asking students questions and trying to get them to respond is often a challenge. Many students know the answer, but are scared to respond. It is usually the same students over and over who answer the questions. This leaves the instructor wondering whether or not the rest of the class is actually comprehending the material. The use of a personal response system (clickers) in the class allows students to respond to questions anonymously. The entire class becomes much more interactive and the instructor knows how well the entire class is grasping the concepts. Clickers can help students stay awake and alert, improve their speed in answering questions, and know whether or not they understand a concept. Finally, clickers can be used to take attendance and reduce tedious record keeping. The use of a clicker system has made a major impact on how these classes respond and a positive effect on learning has been achieved.},

While researchers have examined the degree to which they promote cognitive and non-cognitive learning outcomes in the classroom, most of their findings are largely mixed and inconclusive. This meta-analysis seeks to resolve the conflicting findings. Specifically, the meta-analysis compared classrooms that did, and did not use ARS-based technologies on different cognitive and non-cognitive learning outcomes to examine the potential effects of using ARS. Overall, we found small but significant effects of using ARS-based technologies on a number of desirable cognitive and non-cognitive learning outcomes. Further analysis revealed that knowledge domain, class size, and the use of clicker questions, are among factors that significantly moderated the summary effect sizes observed among the studies in the meta-analysis. These findings hold significant implication for the implementation of clicker-based technologies in the classroom.},

The study utilized a quasi-experimental research design. To assess the differences between the effects of clickers and mobile polling, the study collected data from two courses at a large research university in Taiwan in which 69 students used either clickers or mobile polling. The results showed that mobile polling along with the JiTT strategy and in-class polls reduce graduate students' anxiety, improve student outcomes in an environment comprising both graduate and undergraduate students, and increase students' attention during polling. However, brainwave data revealed that during the polling activities, students' attention in the clicker and mobile polling groups respectively increased and decreased. Students nowadays do not find smartphones a novelty; however, incorporating them into class is still a potentially effective way to increase student attention and provide a direct way for instructors to observe the learning effects of lectures and improve their teaching approach on that basis. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of writing were determined within the context of multiple covariables. Results indicated that the writing group significantly improved critical thinking skills whereas the nonwriting group did not. Specifically, analysis and inference skills increased significantly in the writing group but not the nonwriting group. Writing students also showed greater gains in evaluation skills; however, these were not significant. In addition to writing, prior critical thinking skill and instructor significantly affected critical thinking performance, whereas other covariables such as gender, ethnicity, and age were not significant. With improved critical thinking skill, general education biology students will be better prepared to solve problems as engaged and productive citizens},

This would improve retention and progression of students and could lead to improved levels of academic success. Designing learning activities to improve student engagement has been considered by many universities. This article evaluates the use of ?Clickers? (a remote voting system) as a mechanism to improve student engagement within the Built Environment discipline.

abstract = {Abstract: This paper describes use of an online Student Response System (SRS) in a pre-qualification course for engineering studies in Norway. The SRS in use, where students answer quizzes using handheld mobile devices like Smartphones, PADs, iPods etc., has been developed at S{\~{A}}¸r-Tr{\~{A}}¸ndelag University College. The development of the SRS was co-funded by the Lifelong Learning Program KA3-ICT in 2009-2010. SRS has been designed to help teachers effortlessly i) break the monotony of a lecture and allow the students to actively take part in the lecture, ii) increase teacher-student interaction, and iii) give teacher and students immediate anonymous feedback on learning outcome. The response system was used in mathematics in two groups with different lecturers during two semesters in 2009-2010. The pedagogical methods in use will be referred to as {\^{a}}€{\oe}Peer Instruction{\^{a}}€ and {\^{a}}€{\oe}Classic{\^{a}}€. In each method the students will answer a multiple choice quiz using their mobile devices. In both cases the result of the quiz will immediately appear as a histogram on a screen in the classroom. The closing parts will also be identical. The lecturer then highlights the correct option in the histogram and explains why this option actually is the correct one. In the Peer Instruction method there will be an additional element. The first poll will be followed by a discussion in student groups, where the students are urged to defend their choice and convince their fellow students that their chosen option is the correct one.  The discussion is then followed by a new individual voting session before the final results are shown and the closing part takes place. The paper will compare this method with the peer instruction method as described in existing literature. The learning outcome will be discussed according to interviews with students and the lecturers{\^{a}}€™ experiences from the classroom. In addition we will analyze students{\^{a}}€™ grades and test results in mathematics with respect to their expected level, based on previous achievements. We will present results showing that},

abstract = {Individual response devices or "clickers" are now being used in many classrooms as an active-learning component of courses. Educators may wonder whether clickers are truly beneficial to learning. This study was designed to examine whether clickers increase retention of lecture material over two days in a more controlled situation than the live classroom. Participants watched a video lecture and were either given clicker questions about the video or no clicker questions with a 'test' occurring two days later. The effect of immediate feedback and the timing of the questions (either throughout the video or all at the end) were assessed. It was found that clicker questions improved memory for material two days later compared to no-clicker controls, provided that immediate feedback was given about each question. Scores two days later actually improved compared to scores on the day of the video when feedback was given about the correct answers. The timing of clicker questions did not affect scores. Results are consistent with studies that took place in more ecologically valid but less controlled live classroom situations. The results may guide educators in the effective use of clickers. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this diverse classroom population, typical urban distractions such as poverty, crime, English as a second language, and lack of parental support contribute to extremely low literacy scores. This classroom study examined the effects of implementing clickers, a student response system, in an urban 5th grade literacy class. Each week children were tested according to the district's adopted basal literacy curriculum series. The weekly tests assessed various story elements such as plot, comprehension, grammar, and vocabulary. The classroom teacher implemented a weekly teacher-led review session prior to testing which incorporated clicker response system technology. This review session engaged students through the use of technology while supporting them on their learned literacy skills. The clicker review sessions proved to be a valuable teaching tool in this urban elementary classroom.},

@article{Cubric2015,
abstract = {Electronic Voting System (EVS) is a classroom technology that provides a means to increase students' engagement, attention and attendance. The purpose of this paper is to provide a deeper insight into students' views on the benefits and challenges of EVS in the context of a large-scale institutional deployment and across different subject areas in higher education. The data were collected from an online survey of 590 students across eleven academic schools at a UK university. The non-linear principal component analysis of 32 question items from the survey showed that learning benefits, classroom-related benefits, usability and student-centered challenges are four distinctive dimensions in student's perceptions of the use of EVS. The non-parametric group comparison tests suggested that there are significant differences in learning benefits and challenges across different subject groups. However, the disparity appears to be related more to the way the EVS was used and the experience of students with it, rather than resulting from disciplinary differences. Content analysis of open questions revealed that summative use and staff competencies are the main issues related to EVS use by students. Finally, despite the overwhelming perception of the ease of use, it was found that usability could be an issue for students when EVS was used for summative assessment. The implications of the study are: for practitioners, it underlines the importance of the focus on formative benefits of EVS as only then and regardless of disciplinary differences, can the promised rewards of the technology be gained; for institutions, it outlines some of the new challenges specific to the large-scale institutional implementation, judged through the lens of students' experience; for researchers, it provides an overview of the literature on large-scale deployment of EVS and it suggests some new areas for research on the use of EVS in higher education.},

@article{Han2014,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Clicker technology is one of the most widely adopted communication systems in college classroom environments. Previous literature reviews on clicker technology have identified and thoroughly documented the advantages, disadvantages, and implications of the use of this technology; the current review is intended to synthesize those earlier findings and recast them in terms of the interrelationship between the “3 Ps” of the 3P model: Presage, Process, and Product factors. Using this guided framework enables the identification of the most up-to-date trends and issues in clicker studies published in peer-reviewed journals since 2009. The review shows that recent clicker studies have examined the effects of clickers in terms of student presage factors (cognitive, non-cognitive, background factors), instructor presage factors (instructor effects and the level of the course taught), process factors (delivery method, instructional activities, and assessment and feedback), and product factors (cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes). A heat-mapping approach is used to facilitate the interpretation of the results. The findings also discuss missing/unaddressed links and the untapped relationshipsamong instructional factors in these studies. This study concludes that teaching and learning with the use of clicker technology is a complex and relational phenomenon; factors that are currently under-explored should be examined using more rigorous research methods to close gaps in the literature and to enhance understanding of the use of clickers in classroom learning environments.},
