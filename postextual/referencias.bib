All responses are instantly displayed, usually in chart form, and subsequently reviewed and discussed by the instructor and the class. This paper offers a comprehensive review of teaching strategies used with ARS and includes a discussion of general, motivational, assessment based, and learning based approaches. Several promising strategies have been identified, particularly collecting formative assessment feedback and peer based instruction. More systematic, detailed research in a broader range of contexts is recommended. },

abstract = {The effects of peer instruction (PI) and formal education (FE) on students' performance, skill, and confidence were investigated. The research was performed in a two-year college classroom with 98 students from two groups enrolled in a physics course. One of the groups was selected as an experimental group, and the other was the control group. The students in the experimental group were instructed by peer instruction with problem solving strategy steps (PSSS), whereas the students in the control group were instructed by formal education including PSSS. The research data were collected with the Physics Achievement Test (PAT) and the Problem Solving Confidence Questionnaire (PSCQ). The problem solving skills of the students in both groups were evaluated using quantitative problems in Newtonian mechanics. The PAT and the PSCQ results related to the performance and confidence of the students indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the means of the experimental group and the control group in favor of the experimental group. The combination of PI with PSSS was more effective for increasing the problem solving skills of the students than the combination of FE with PSSS. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Freeman2014,
abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6{\%} in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes-although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

These improvements are intended to help students learn more from pre-class reading and to increase student engagement in the discussion sections, and are accompanied by further increases in student understanding.},

Peer Instruction is an instructional strategy for engaging students during class through a structured questioning process that involves every student. Here we describe Peer Instruction (hereafter PI) and report data from more than ten years of teaching with PI in the calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics courses for non-majors at Harvard University, where this method was developed. Our results indicate increased student mastery of both conceptual reasoning and quantitative problem solving upon implementing PI. Gains in student understanding are greatest when the PI questioning strategy is accompanied by other strategies that increase student engagement, so that every element of the course serves to involve students actively. We also provide data on gains in student understanding and information about implementation obtained from a survey of almost four hundred instructors using PI at other institutions. We find that most of these instructors have had success using PI, and that their students understand basic mechanics concepts at the level characteristic of courses taught with interactive engagement methods. Finally, we provide a sample set of materials for teaching a class with PI, and provide information on the extensive resources available for teaching with PI.},

abstract = {As more and more educational institutions are integrating new technologies (e.g. audience response systems) into their learning systems to support the learning process, it is becoming increasingly necessary to have a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these advanced technologies and their consequences on student learning performance. In this study, our primary objective is to investigate the effect of clickers (i.e. audience response systems) on student learning performance. To do so, we develop a conceptual framework in which we propose that interactivity, active collaborative learning and engagement are three key underlying forces that explain the positive effects and benefits of clickers in enhancing student learning performance. We test these relationships empirically in a university class setting using data from a survey answered by students in a social sciences degree. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework and they reveal that the high level of interactivity with peers and with the teacher that is promoted by the use of clickers positively influences active collaborative learning and engagement, which, in turn, improves student learning performance. These results show the importance of clickers in improving the student learning experience and recommend their use in educational settings to support the learning process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
